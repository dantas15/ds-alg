## Longest consecutive sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, the task is to find the length of the longest consecutive sequen ce in a given array of integers such that all elements of the consecutive sequence are sorted in strictly ascending order.

For example, the length of the longest consecutive sequence for `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]` is `4` since the longest increasing consecutive sequence is `[1, 2, 3 4]`.
